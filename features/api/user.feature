    Given I authenticate myself as admin

  Scenario: Get a collection
    When I send a GET request to "/api/users"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And I should get a paged collection with the context "/api/contexts/User"

  Scenario: Get a resource
    When I send a GET request to "/api/users/1"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the JSON node "createdAt" should be a string

    And the JSON node "jobs" should have 1 element
    And the JSON node "types" should have 1 element
    And the JSON node "roles" should have 2 elements
    Then the JSON response should should have the following nodes:
